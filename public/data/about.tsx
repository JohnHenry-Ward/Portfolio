    { key: 1, text: "Hey there! Thank you for taking the time to stop by. I built this site to give a more personal look into who I am as a person and a Software Engineer. I wanted to showcase the side of me that isn't always listed on a resume (though you can still find mine under the Resume button up top). With today's focus on optimizing LinkedIn profiles and resumes, it's often difficult to convey that I am more than my career. I wanted to display my non-career interests alongside my career achievements so you can get a better idea of who I am." },
    { key: 2, text: "I am a Software Engineer with 2 years of experience, primarily focused on backend development, but I have a passion for full-stack development. Many of my projects are full-stack web apps, and I aspire to work professionally as a full-stack engineer. I really enjoy combining my interests with software development, and I find the most joy when I build something around a subject matter or focus that I am passionate about. You can see some of these in the projects section." },
    { key: 3, text: "I graduated in December 2021 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics from Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington. I greatly enjoyed my time at WWU, and Bellingham feels like a second home now. My experience at WWU, especially in the CS community there, is not something I take for granted. After graduating, I was excited to join the industry and have an impact wherever I went." }, 
    { key: 4, text: "My professional journey began when I was hired by AKASA in April 2022. For the 2 years I was there, I built workflows that automated the revenue cycle process for hospital networks in the US. Although I had no prior experience with the revenue cycle, I quickly learned what was needed to succeed in this role and gained valuable experience that I can apply in my future roles and personal projects. At AKASA, I worked within a small team of engineers, collaborating with non-technical teams to design, implement, deploy, monitor, and debug workflows. This was a remote role, so communication and teamwork were key, and I found that I could thrive in a remote environment. Unfortunately, in April 2024, my team and I were let go." },
    { key: 5, text: "Since then, I’ve been taking this time to level up my skills so that I am ready when I find my next role. I’ve worked with a career coach. and received valuable advice from former coworkers and friends. I’m looking for a role that aligns with my values, and one that excites me. Learning and growth are very important to me, so I want a role where I can continuously improve. I also know that communication, teamwork, and leadership are things that I value highly, so an organization that shares these values would be a great fit for me." },
    { key: 6, text: "Outside of my career, I am a movie buff and am currently making my way through the A Song of Ice and Fire Novels. I love getting outside to soak up any sunshine I can in the PNW, and I'm a fan of baseball (Go Mariners!), football (Go Seahawks), and soccer (Go Sounders!). At home, I enjoy spending time with my partner and our two cats. I'm excited about the future and eager to find my next opportunity where I can contribute, learn, and grow. Thank you for taking the time to check out my site. If you’d like to reach me, my contact information is at the bottom of the page."}
